# Gakusei_No_Amazupai_Seikatsu_V.1.23.12
A Visual Novel Game Project about building relationships with different characters that you encounter at a school setting. 
I only put the rpy files in order for renpy devs to quickly seearch for some renpy game mechanics that we did within the game.
Some mechanics that we have are image point and clicker, username input, scoring and such.
The whole game will be released in Itch.io within this month.

Enjoy this mockup front and back cover of our game.
